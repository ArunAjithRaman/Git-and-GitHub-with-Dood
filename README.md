# dood

This repository is created for giving Demo on Git & GitHub

Things I did for making this repository.

+ Created a empty repository named `dood` in [GitHub](https://github.com/new).
+ Copied the contents from the page titled `create a new repository on the command line` and the lines are 
```
echo "# dood" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/ArunAjithRaman/dood.git
git push -u origin main
